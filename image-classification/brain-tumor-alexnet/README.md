### **Observations**

#### Training Summary

* **Model parameters**:

  * Total: 187M
  * Trainable: 62M
  * Optimizer state: 124M
  * This model is **very large**, especially given the dataset size (5712 training images).
* **Optimizer**: `Adam(learning_rate=1e-4)`
* **Callbacks**: Learning rate scheduler, checkpointing, early stopping

#### Performance Trends

* **Best validation accuracy**: \~78.59% (Epoch 5)
* **Final test accuracy**: \~59.42%
* **Gap between training and validation accuracy**:

  * Training: \~83% by end
  * Validation: Drops after Epoch 5 and ends at \~60%
  * Test: Only \~59.4%
* **Significant overfitting** after Epoch 5
* **Loss values** fluctuate sharply in later epochs (e.g., `val_loss = 6.4189` at Epoch 7)

#### ⚠️ Warning

* I'm using the **legacy `.h5` format**. And it is recommended to switch to the **`.keras`** format using:

  ```python
  model.save('brain_tumor_model.keras')
  ```

### ❗ Diagnosis: **Overfitting**

My model performs well on the training data but generalizes poorly to the validation and test sets. I believe, the overfitting is likely due to:

1. **Model Complexity**: 62 million trainable parameters are excessive for \~6k images.
2. **Lack of Regularization**: No dropout, L2 regularization, or data augmentation was reported.
3. **Imbalanced Dataset**: Performance issues could be compounded if class distribution is skewed.

### Recommended Actions

#### 1. **Reduce Model Complexity**

Either reduce the size of AlexNet implementation or replace it with a **pretrained lightweight model** such as:

* `MobileNetV2`
* `EfficientNetB0`
* `ResNet50` (frozen base for transfer learning)

Example:

```python
base_model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(
    include_top=False,
    input_shape=(227, 227, 3),
    weights='imagenet'
)
base_model.trainable = False
```

#### 2. **Apply Regularization**

* **Dropout** in fully connected layers (e.g., 0.5)
* **L2 weight regularization** (`kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001)`)

#### 3. **Enhance Data Augmentation**

Apply stronger augmentations using `ImageDataGenerator`:

```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)
```

#### 4. **Use a Validation Set**

Separate a portion of the training data for validation:

```python
validation_split=0.2
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    directory=train_path,
    target_size=(227, 227),
    batch_size=16,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='training',
    color_mode='rgb'
)
valid_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    directory=train_path,
    target_size=(227, 227),
    batch_size=16,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='validation',
    color_mode='rgb'
)
```

#### 5. **Evaluate with Confusion Matrix**

To better understand misclassifications across the 4 tumor classes, generate a confusion matrix:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

Y_pred = alexnet_model.predict(test_generator)
y_pred = np.argmax(Y_pred, axis=1)
print('Confusion Matrix')
print(confusion_matrix(test_generator.classes, y_pred))
print('Classification Report')
print(classification_report(test_generator.classes, y_pred, target_names=classes))
```

### Visual Clarity

I have already plotted the accuracy and loss curves, which show divergence after Epoch 5. That’s another strong sign of overfitting. Early stopping and model checkpointing are correctly set up, though more aggressive regularization is needed.
